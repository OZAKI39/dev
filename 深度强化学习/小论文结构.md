1. Abstract
[研究的范围、目的、重要性、任务和前提条件]
Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning endows an agent with a large variety of skills, but it often struggles to solve tasks that require more temporally extended reasoning.
[研究方法与主要内容]
In this work, we propose to incorporate imagined subgoals into policy learning to facilitate learning of complex tasks. Imagined subgoals are predicted by a separate
high-level policy, which is trained simultaneously with the policy and its critic.……
[结果与结论]
We evaluate our approach on complex robotic navigation and manipulation tasks and show that it outperforms existing methods by a large margin

2. Introduction
[描述背景（涉及标题中的关键词）]
An intelligent agent aims at solving tasks of varying horizons in an environment. It must be able to identify how the different tasks intertwine with each other and leverage behaviors learned by solving simpler tasks to efficiently master more complex tasks.……
